Thank you so much Algorand Foundation and Happy New Year! Let this year be the year of getting Algorand dApps into production.

We have made a lot of progress with Genadrop. Right now genadrop is used by artists to generate art. We have even been spending time adding functionality as we launch NFT drops to help the creative process.
